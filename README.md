# Estimating Animal Poses with Neural Networks
## No installation is necessary if run in Colab.
## This program uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to perform image recognition on the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 contains 32x32 RGB images of airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. If done correctly, the model should be able to surpass human accuracy for this task. The last two lines of the output show the testing results. The rest of the output details training progress.
